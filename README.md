# week-6-weather-dashboard


## Description 

This project was aimed to create a weather dashboard that will show the current weather and 5 day weather for a location when that location has been inputted in the input section. 


## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```


## Usage 

* The dashboard consists of a search bar, a main dashboard and a 5 day weather card section as well as a recent locations section
* When the user inputs a location and clicks on the search button, the current weather and subsequent 5 day weather for that location is populated on the page 
* The location is then saved to local storage and when the user refreshes the page, the location they have previously searched will be populated in the 'recent location' section 
* There is also a 'clear search' button where the recent location section is cleared up when the 'clear search' button is selected
